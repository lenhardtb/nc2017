                <li>This was made for Net-Centric Computing class by Bo Lenhardt, finished on February 1st, 2017.</li>
                <li>Bo has been a fan of webcomics for a few years, so this seemed like a good idea to create some content for.</li>
                <li>They are aware that these are 90% fantasy and will never apologize for it.</li>
                <li>There will probably be many more projects about webcomics because Bo is not creative.</li>
