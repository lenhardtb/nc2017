                    <br>After a world known as Aether attempted to invade Earth across a fold in space,
                    society is thrown into chaos as worlds and species interact. We follow the stories of Hawk and Lily,
                    two siblings, one monster and one human, separated in one resulting conflict.

                    <br>Transformation guns, super-powerful alien squirrels, anime-style martial arts, immortal beings, and magic sex changes??
                    El Goonish Shive is full of fantasy and comedy and hijinks, but the story will take you turns you've never seen before. 
                    Get through the art in the first few chapters and you'll be a fan, too.

                    <br>Almost a century ago, a virus swept over Earth. Infecting human and beast alike, it turned them into trolls -
                    grotesque piles of flesh and bone who wander searching for more "food". 
                    The cities have been walled off for longer than anyone remembers,
                    and one team is hired to explore the Silent World outside.

                    <br>Dumbing of Age is a webcomic about college freshmen in the girls wing within a co-ed dorm, 
                    learning everything about life and themselves - usually in the most difficult ways.  
                    It stars a Christian homeschooled girl and her atheist best friend, 
                    a disgraced cheerleader, a misanthrope, a rebel, and a caped vigilante.

                    <br>First we meet Thistle: a mysterious, shy mage who never removes her hood and facial coverings.
                    Bad things happen to people who see what's underneath. But she reveals great power in her new role
                    as a member of a guild, adventuring with Brent the berserker, Orrig the orc, and Lyra, the feisty archer. 
                    Demons both metaphorical and literal are defeated in this beautiful story of love and the forms it takes.

                    <br>Michelle Jocasta is starting college and everything starts going okay - until she touches a strange medallion and turns into some half-lion, half-bird ... thing.
                    Michelle is a sphinx, one of many creatures hidden from humanity under disguising spells. With this new discovery comes the revelation that all the sphinxes in the world
                    have been wiped out in a war several hundred years ago, and they were the only ones who knew the secret of the disguising medallions.

                    one with the power to open portals to other worlds via the power of their name: 
                    strange, fantasy, and fairy-tale lands we know thanks to literature, cinema, and folks tales.
                    Yet all namesakes follow one rule - Alices always go to Wonderland, Jacks always go to slay giants.
                    Their names dictate the story they connect to.
                    Yet Emma finds herself in Oz - why?

                    <br>[The technological singularity is the hypothesis that accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect

                    in an event called the singularity.
                    <br>
                    <br>Because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible for a human to comprehend,
