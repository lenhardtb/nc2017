                Webcomics are an interesting development in the interaction between the popular comic format and the internet.
                Many artists have started publishing comics of their own, one page or one strip at a time. 
                <br><br>Some profit off of it. Some do it for fun.
                <br><br>Most will post one or two pages of a comic per week, but there are exceptions - almost all have strict update schedules, though. 
                Some update monthly or bimonthly. A few update with single strips every day!
                <br><br>The webcomic community is surprisingly compassionate. 
                The artists behind comics are people, after all, and sometimes they need breaks -
                not to mention that most are doing it for free or in their spare time anyway!
                <br><br>When a comic goes <i>on hiatus</i>, responses are usually overwhelmingly forgiving because of this widely accepted mentality.
                Few will only read one or two comics, however, so even so you can usually just keep receiving updates from other comics.
                It's not long before you get hooked and suddenly you have dozens of your favorites' schedules memorized and a hundred bookmarks besides.
                <br><br>It's important to pace yourself and not look for new ones when you're too busy. Happy hunting!
                
                <br><br><i>*psst! services like <a href="http://www.tapastic.com">tapastic.com</a> are helpful for keeping track of comics' updates. But be careful to remember that there are people behind these - and none of them owes you anything! Don't be a jerk.*</i>
